## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first practiced project with Frontend Mentor. I'm just start. 
For this lesson I learned about flexbox and @media screen for managed with frontend and responsive screen for this preview review card.

### Continued development

Next step is dev with React/Vue framework, practice to build with scss/Bootstrap 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
